* Description: All valid commands we could run into, from here
*              we can assemble to machine language and use
*              the machine code as test input for our 
*              disassembler. DECIMAL AND BINARY IMMEDIATE 
*              DATA AND ADDRESSING NOT CONSIDERED SINCE
*              MACHINE LAGUAGE IS ALL HEX ANYHOW
